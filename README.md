== dataset-creator
vp = vertical partitioning -> each predicate to its own table

  runDriver with 3 args:
1: 'working directory: where the indexes are placed; ./VP ./ExtVP'
2: 'inFile - file within the working directory'
3: 'joinType: VP, ss, so, os' (VP must be used first; ss, so and os are then generated under expVP)
4: 'some threshold of when to not create the extVP index - 1 which always creates all extVP; lorenz thinks it was 0.7 in the authors scripts'
